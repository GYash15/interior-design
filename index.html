                      Bedroom is the most comfortable place in my house. It becomes my favorite room since I lived in this house five years ago. Actually it is not too large, the width is just 4 x 4 meters, but it is clean enough. It looks like a small cottage with a bed placed in the corner of this room. The color of the bed cover is pink, so soft and calm. On this bed, there  are a pillow, a bolster, and 15 cute dolls that always accompany me when I am sleeping. If you enter to my bedroom, you can see a table and a chair next to the bed as my  place for you to study.Bedroom is a place to relax.

                Bathroom has to be one of the prettiest rooms in our house. The floor and the walls are of white tile, which are shiny and clean. There is a beautiful ocean wave design consisting of three different shades of blue. These waves go around on all four walls and are about a third of the way up the wall from the floor. In the waves, there are blue and yellow striped angelfish and numerous different seashells. There are two windows in the bathroom, both of which have dark blue shades. We have many little porcelain ships placed all over the shelves and a mirror that resembles the steering wheel of a sailboat.
